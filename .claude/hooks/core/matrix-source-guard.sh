# matrix-source-guard.sh - The Source Protection Enforcement
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Guards The Source (psi/source/) from unauthorized writes.
#   The Source is ALWAYS protected unless explicitly unlocked.
#
# PROTOCOL:
#   If .UNLOCK exists → Allow the edit (temporary access)
#   If .UNLOCK absent → BLOCK the edit (default protected)
#
# USAGE:
#   Called automatically by Claude Code PreToolUse hook
#   Receives tool data via JSON on stdin (Claude Code hook protocol)
#
# TO UNLOCK:
#   touch psi/source/.UNLOCK
#
# TO RE-LOCK:
#   rm psi/source/.UNLOCK
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0 = Allow the operation
#   2 = Block the operation (shows stderr to Claude)
#
# ============================================================
